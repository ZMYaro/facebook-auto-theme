# Auto Theme for Facebook

Previously, you could set Facebook to have a dark or light theme, but not to have it match your operating system dark/light theme.  This extension would match your Facebook theme to your system theme.

**This extension is now obsolete due to Facebook adding the “Automatic” option under Display &amp; accessibility settings:**
